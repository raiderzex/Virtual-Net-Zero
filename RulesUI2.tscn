Rule 1. The game involves placing down modules in a turn-based setting.

Rule 2. Each turn represents 1 year, and the game ends after 30 years have passed.

Rule 3. Players can place up to as many blocks as their budget of $75m can afford within the year.

Rule 4. Players will aim to hit certain target goals by the end of the 30 years and a score will be given to determine how well the players have done. Not all goals have to or can be met within a single game.
