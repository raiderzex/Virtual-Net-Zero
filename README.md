# Virtual-Net-Zero
 M.Arch Thesis Project

This project was made for my SUTD M.Arch thesis.

I would like to credit the makers of the plugins that I have used in this game for making tools to ease my game development journey.
I would also like to credit Amzker for making a guide on how to export data from Godot to Google Spreadsheet using Apps Script, which I have followed to export post game data.
